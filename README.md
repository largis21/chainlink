# Chainlink

Chainlink is an open-source Api-platform for:

* documenting and testing Api- endpoints and [chains](#what-is-a-chain)

* documenting how integrations to other Api's within your applications are implemented

* documenting how other applications can use your Api

### What is a chain

When working with REST Api's, you often need to use multiple requests in a chain to get the data you need.

It is equivalent to a "flow" in Postman. I was also gonna use flow, but I thought chainlink was a cool name B)

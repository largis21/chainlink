### ⚠️  There is no windows support in this repo yet. If you want/need that, please create a pr

Editors note:
I do thoroughly believe that coding in native windows is the worst thing one can do to itself.
I have wasted countless hours peer programming with colleagues, just waiting for their npm scripts 
to run in windows (Honorary mention: deleting node_modules).

- Please use WSL, Linux or MacOs

I will accept pr's adding windows support though, because I respect your choice to use an inferior os :-)
